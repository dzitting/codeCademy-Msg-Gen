## How Does This Work?
The gameplace is to address separate parts of a sentence and construct a full sentence randomly.

### Starting
The user will come to a blank box with instructive text, asking to press the button.
Once the button is pressed a new sentence will generate.

### Running the Application
Have React, node.js installed on the computer. Open the terminal and run `npm start`. This will run the live development server and you can test the application. Quit using `ctrl` + `c`.
